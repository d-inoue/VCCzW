# The steps below need to be performed in conjunction with the addition of a new
# slave server. It involves a temporary lock of the tables.

# Once the slave is ready to begin performing replication, run the following:

mysql -u root -p'<%= node['mariadb']['server_root_password'] %>'
FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;
SHOW MASTER STATUS;

# In another terminal, perform a mysqldump

mysqldump -u root -p'<%= node['mariadb']['server_root_password'] %>' --all-databases > dump.sql

# Move this file over to the new slave and import it. Once imported, run the 
# following in the SQL terminal:

UNLOCK TABLES;
